              Started my career as a front-end web developer during student
              internship back in college. Shifted my career to application
              configuration analyst where it didn't only tested my skills as a
              web developer but also communication and problem-solving skills.
              After one year of being an analyst, I went back to being front-end
              web developer in Software Developer title. As I indulge myself
              with helping the back-end support, I decided to take my career to
              be a full-stack developer.
