            Started my career as a front-end web developer during student
            internship back in college. Shifted my career to application
            configuration analyst where it didn't only tested my skills as a web
            developer but also communication and problem-solving skills. After
            one year of being an analyst, I went back to being front-end web
            developer as Software Developer. As I indulge myself helping with
            back-end, I decided to take my career to be a full-stack developer.
